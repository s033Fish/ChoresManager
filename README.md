Welcome to TotalFootball!
Thank you for visiting TotalFootball, your ultimate destination for an exciting and user-friendly fantasy soccer experience. Here’s an overview of how fantasy soccer works and what our application offers:

What is Fantasy Soccer?
Fantasy soccer allows you to create and manage a team of players from the top five European soccer leagues:

Premier League
Serie A
La Liga
Bundesliga
Ligue 1
In real-life matches, players earn points based on their performances, such as:

Goals Scored
Assists Provided
Tackles Made
Saves Completed (Goalkeepers)
Your fantasy team earns points based on the real-life performance of the players you select. The goal? To accumulate more points than other teams in your league and become the season champion.

How Does TotalFootball Work?
Team Composition:

Each fantasy team consists of 15 players, including:
11 Starters:
1 Goalkeeper
4 Defenders
4 Midfielders
2 Forwards
4 Bench Players
These serve as substitutes for your starters if needed.
Player Selection:

Players are selected during a snake draft, where league participants take turns choosing players. The draft order reverses after each round to ensure fairness.
Player Performance and Scoring:

Points are assigned based on real-life player performance during league matches.
Examples of scoring metrics include:
Goals Scored: Earn points for your team.
Assists Provided: Boost your score.
Defensive Actions: Such as tackles and saves.
Live Updates:

We fetch player statistics from the Rapid Football API.
Our application uses AJAX requests every six hours to update player stats, ensuring you have the latest performance data.
The Waiver Wire:

If you want to replace a player on your team, you can pick up available players from the waiver wire—a pool of unselected or dropped players. You can submit claims to add them to your team.
Winning the League:

The winner is determined by the total points accumulated by their team over the season. Manage your lineup strategically to maximize your score.
